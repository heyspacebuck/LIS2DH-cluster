# LIS2DH-cluster

Many accelerometers controlled by a single computer.

## What's the goal here?

Like a lot of my projects, this is a study of vibration. I want to connect a dozen or so LIS2DH accelerometers to a vibrating device and take recordings 400-ish times a second.

Can it be done? We'll see. Right now I'm only able to get 1 sensor to record about 250 times a second. So I my code to run approximately 20 times faster!

More details forthcoming.
