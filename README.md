# LIS2DH-cluster

Many accelerometers controlled by a single computer.

## What's the goal here?

Like a lot of my projects, this is a study of vibration. I want to connect a dozen or so LIS2DH accelerometers to a vibrating device and take recordings 400-ish times a second.

Can it be done? We'll see. Right now (on a Raspberry Pi Zero W) I'm able to get 1 sensor to record about 2400 times a second, or 3 sensors recording about 1200 times a second. So I need my code to run a little faster. This is probably feasible on a beefier Raspberry Pi.

More details forthcoming.
